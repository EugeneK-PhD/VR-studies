To replace the eye textures with a different one, go to your eyeball_l and eyeball_r materials, and select the eye from there. 

You might have to mess around with the tiling and Offset for the eyes if you decide to use a different texture, 
This is due to how the textures were designed and mapped out to the original models.

I've included the eyes from various other HL2 NPCs, other Source engine games and/or mods for HL2, some even from 
G-mod playermodels.

I've also included different Ambient Occulusion Eye textures as well as 2 different Cubemap Eye reflections. 
(For use as a Spec Map)
